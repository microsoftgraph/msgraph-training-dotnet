# Manually configure the sample

## Register an application

You can register an application using the Azure Active Directory admin center, or by using the [Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/powershell/get-started).

> **NOTE**
> The PowerShell script requires a work/school account with the Application administrator, Cloud application administrator, or Global administrator role. If your account has the Application developer role, you can register in the Azure AD admin center.

### Azure Active Directory admin center

1. Open a browser and navigate to the [Azure Active Directory admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com) and login using a **personal account** (aka: Microsoft Account) or **Work or School Account**.

1. Select **Azure Active Directory** in the left-hand navigation, then select **App registrations** under **Manage**.

1. Select **New registration**. Enter a name for your application, for example, `.NET Graph Tutorial`.

1. Set **Supported account types** as desired. The options are:

    | Option | Who can sign in? |
    |--------|------------------|
    | **Accounts in this organizational directory only** | Only users in your Microsoft 365 organization |
    | **Accounts in any organizational directory** | Users in any Microsoft 365 organization (work or school accounts) |
    | **Accounts in any organizational directory ... and personal Microsoft accounts** | Users in any Microsoft 365 organization (work or school accounts) and personal Microsoft accounts |

1. Leave **Redirect URI** empty.

1. Select **Register**. On the application's **Overview** page, copy the value of the **Application (client) ID** and save it, you will need it in the next step. If you chose **Accounts in this organizational directory only** for **Supported account types**, also copy the **Directory (tenant) ID** and save it.

1. Select **Authentication** under **Manage**. Locate the **Advanced settings** section and change the **Allow public client flows** toggle to **Yes**, then choose **Save**.

### PowerShell

To use PowerShell, you'll need the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK. If you do not have it, see [Install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/powershell/installation) for installation instructions.

1. Open PowerShell and run the [RegisterAppForUserAuth.ps1](RegisterAppForUserAuth.ps1) file with the following command, replacing *&lt;audience-value&gt;* with the desired value (see table below).

    > **Note:** The RegisterAppForUserAuth.ps1 script requires a work/school account with the Application administrator, Cloud application administrator, or Global administrator role.

    ```powershell
    .\RegisterAppForUserAuth.ps1 -AppName ".NET Graph Tutorial" -SignInAudience <audience-value>
    ```

    | SignInAudience value | Who can sign in? |
    |----------------------|------------------|
    | `AzureADMyOrg` | Only users in your Microsoft 365 organization |
    | `AzureADMultipleOrgs` | Users in any Microsoft 365 organization (work or school accounts) |
    | `AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount` | Users in any Microsoft 365 organization (work or school accounts) and personal Microsoft accounts |
    | `PersonalMicrosoftAccount` | Only personal Microsoft accounts |

1. Copy the **Client ID** and **Auth tenant** values from the script output. You will need these values in the next step.

    ```powershell
    SUCCESS
    Client ID: 2fb1652f-a9a0-4db9-b220-b224b8d9d38b
    Auth tenant: common
    ```

## Configure the sample

1. Open [appsettings.json](./GraphTutorial/appsettings.json) and update the values according to the following table.

    | Setting | Value |
    |---------|-------|
    | `clientId` | The client ID of your app registration |
    | `authTenant` | If you chose the option to only allow users in your organization to sign in, change this value to your tenant ID. Otherwise leave as `common`. |
